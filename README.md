Choose any of the state management techniques shown today and perform the following task:

In the boilerplate code, only the button for addition is given. Add three more FloatingAction buttons- for subtraction, multiplication and division respectively. On pressing the buttons,  respective functions will be performed, just like today's session where on clicking the buttons, addition and subtraction were performed.
